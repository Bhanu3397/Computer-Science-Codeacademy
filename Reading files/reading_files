Reading a File:-We can use .read() to read a file.

Iterating Through Lines:-We can use for loop to iterate through the file.

Reading a Line:-Sometimes you don’t want to iterate through a whole file. For that, there’s a different file method, .readline(), which will only read a single line at a time.

Writing a File:-Reading a file is all well and good, but what if we want to create a file of our own? With Python we can do just that. It turns out that our open() function that we’re using to open a file to read needs another argument to open a file to write to.

Appending to a File:- we open it with 'a' for append-mode. 

What's With "with"?:- It'll auto close the file otherwise you have to close file with .close() statement.

Reading a CSV File:- In Python we can convert that data into a dictionary using the csv library’s DictReader object. 
We pass the additional keyword argument newline='' to the file opening open() function so that we don’t accidentally mistake a line break in one of our data fields as a new row in our CSV

Writing a CSV File:-
.writeheader(), .writerow()

Reading a JSON File:-
Python comes with a json package that will help us parse JSON files into actual Python dictionaries. 
json.load(), creating a Python dictionary out of the file. 

Writing a JSON File:-json.dump() method to write to the file.
