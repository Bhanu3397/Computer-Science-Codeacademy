#Boolean Expressions
#We can create boolean expressions by comparing two values using these operators:
1 == 1 #True
2 != 4 #True
3 == 5 #False

'''Try and Except Statements:-if, elif, and else statements arenâ€™t the only way to build a control flow into your program. You can use try and except statements to check for possible errors that a user might encounter.
The general syntax of a try and except statement is
try:
    # some statement
except ErrorName:
    # some statement
First, the statement under try will be executed. If at some point an exception is raised during this execution, such as a NameError or a ValueError and that exception matches the keyword in the except statement, then the try statement will terminate and the except statement will execute.
